# awesome-google-communities-certification

This repository will mainly contain the guidelines about the Google Associate Android Developer Certification. How a beginner can start their journey as an Android Developer and achieve AAD certification. We will be adding more certification guidelines as we will have some expert mentoring this part.
There will be a community folder where we will explore about the chapters or local communities running by Google. There will be a sub folder where we can meet all the great people doing great jobs for communities and become an inspiration.
